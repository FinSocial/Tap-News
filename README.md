# Tap News
## Overview
This is a real-time news scraping and recommendation system. I built a news pipeline to scraping real-time latest news from a bunch of news source such as CNN, BBC, ESPN and TechCrunch. Created a single-page web application to show the news to users, and recommend news to users based on users' click behavior on different news topic. 
## Architecture
### News Pipeline
### Machine Learning
The news topic classification is implemented by Convolutional Neutral Nework(CNN) in TensorFlow and deployed online.
